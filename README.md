# LeafSegmentation

LeafSeg is a Python-based image segmentation project designed for isolating leaves in images with cluttered backgrounds. Utilizing color features and thresholding techniques, LeafSeg creates a binary segmentation that accurately extracts the main leaf regions. This project aims to provide a simple and effective solution for researchers and developers working with plant image analysis.

# Key Features:

Color-based segmentation
Thresholding for greenness
Morphological operations for cleanup
Single connected component output

# Usage:
import skimage.io as io

from leafseg import segleaf

image = io.imread("path/to/your/image.jpg")

segmented_image = segleaf(image)


# Dependencies:

NumPy
scikit-image
Matplotlib
